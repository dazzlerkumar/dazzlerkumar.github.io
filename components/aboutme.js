                            Worked as a part-time Front-End Website Developer for about 3 months in a start-up with 
experience building User Interfaces of the website using the NextJS (ReactJS) framework.

                                I describe myself as a focused, fast learner,
                                curious and grateful person. I see and find
                                patterns in day-to-day life, and keep optimizing
                                my daily life.
